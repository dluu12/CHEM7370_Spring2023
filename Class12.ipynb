    "## Visualizing p orbitals\n",
    "An orbital is a wavefunction for one electron. In the hydrogen atom, there is only one electron so the entire electronic wavefunction is an orbital, and the only atom for which we have explicit formulas for orbitals is the hydrogen atom. For many-electron atoms or molecules, we can only approximately assign electrons to individual orbitals (we can get these orbitals by solving Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham equations), so molecular orbitals are a model that is not exactly correct, but very useful nonetheless. None of it matters for today's class though...\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, our goal is to visualize the orbitals for a hydrogen atom, focusing specifically on the *2p* and *3p* orbitals. We have seen many orbital pictures, but do we *really* understand what they represent? The reason visualizing orbitals is tricky is because we are dealing with a function of three variables, *f(x,y,z)*. \n",
